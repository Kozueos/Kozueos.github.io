        <h2>About Our Trip</h2>
        <p>David and Harrison are packing their bags for the month of november and doing a WHIRLWIND trip of 
            the southern states. On November 8th, we catch a plane from Seattle to Lousiana, rent a car, and 
            get moving! 10 Cities in 20 days, and not a clue what we're going to visit in each one! What we 
            want are your suggestions of your favorite restaurants, historical sites, and just cool places to 
            see!</p>
